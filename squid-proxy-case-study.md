## Introduction

Caching tools are unlike databases designed to keep information for a short period of time.
‚ÄúCaching is a process that stores multiple copies of data or files in a temporary storage location- or cache- so they can be accessed faster.‚Äù

The data stored in a cache can be HTML files, images, documents, DNS records and API calls. There are different types of caching tools, in-memory caching, disk caching, distributed caching and reverse proxy caching.  
A proxy web server is a reverse proxy caching, a caching HTTP reverse proxy, and this is the type of caching tool that Squid web proxies are.
Squid proxies is a provider of shared and private HTTP/HTTPS proxies.
The meaning of proxy is a middleman between you and something, and a proxy web server serves as a middleman between your computer and the internet pages you want to visit. The software provides you with IP addresses, and sends them to the website you visit instead of your own IP address, keeping your identity and location, and all of your metadata, safe and secret.
This improves security for you and your data, it allows you to browse privately, can help if you want to watch content restricted for your location, and improves on connection speeds and bandwidth. The use for this can be many, and proxy web server service are used both for personal use and for businesses.

## Brief History

Caching has been used since the start of the internet, but at the beginning it was done more on the client side than the server side, which has changed, due to issues with data duplication and source of truth.
1996- Squid was developed by The National Laboratory for Applied Network Research (NLANR). Squid was the earliest reverse proxy project that still exist, and is still very popular today, with users.

## Main Features

Caching- frequently accessed content and websites get stored in cache memory, to reduce loading time and bandwidth for the next visit(er).
Forwarding- client requests can be forwarded to web clients, retrieved and delivered to client. This keeps clients private, and can give the possibility of other services like access control, authentication, content filtering and traffic optimization.
Access control- this can allow the possibility to offer access control, allowing restrictions for IP addresses and content, and give CEO the tools to

Authentication
Content filtering
Traffic optimization
